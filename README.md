# Actix Diesel
> Integrate Diesel into Actix (and Actix Web) cleanly and efficiently.

This crate allows for a simple async interface to `diesel` powered by `actix`. It's main goal is to provide
`actix-web` users an elegant interface to `diesel` however it can be used without the web portions.

## Usage

See [the example](examples/web) for detailed usage information.

```rust
async fn index(state: State<AppState>) -> Result<Json<User>> {
    Ok(await!(users::table.load_async(&state.db))?)
}
```
